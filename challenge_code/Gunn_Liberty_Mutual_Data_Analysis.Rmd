## Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering 

Load data and necessary libraries in R.  
```{r message=FALSE}
library(readr)
Coding_Exercise_Dataset <- read_csv("LibMut/Coding Exercise Dataset.csv")
```


```{r cars}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
